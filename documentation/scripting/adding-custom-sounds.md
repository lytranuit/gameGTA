# Sounds

It is highly recommended that you keep your sounds compressed and keep the quality below `128`. We use the open source format known as `.ogg` for this game mode so it's recommended that you download [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) if you plan on doing a lot of audio editing.

You can place sounds inside of

```
src/core/client/views/hud/html/sounds
```

## Editing Sounds with Audacity

If you have never used Audacity before. It's actually quite simple to use.

Simply highlight the areas with your cursor that you want to remove and press `del` to remove the sections.

Then you are ready to export. Go to file `file -> export-> ogg`

I usually change the quality to about `5` when I export. The quality won't matter that much for most of these small sounds.
