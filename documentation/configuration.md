# Configuration

There is only so many configuration options that can be exported and tweaked. However, there is a consistent effort to try and allow as much customization as possible through a single configuration file.

## Where is the Main Configuration?

The main configuration can be found in `src/core/server/athena/main.ts`

## What about the Rest?

Maintain a private repo to make configuration changes yourself.
