# Introduction

## Summary

This project solely exists as a new standard for GTA 5 roleplay scripts on the [alt:V](https://altv.mp/) client. The Athena Roleplay Script for GTA 5 has type safety through TypeScript and a solid foundation for what is considered core for a Roleplay server. You can find a list of features for the Athena Roleplay Script below in the Feature List section.

**BEFORE YOU CONSIDER THIS FRAMEWORK**

* You need to know how to use command line.
* You need to know Typescript / Javascript.
* You need to be self-starting and self-learning.
* You need to understand how to run commands in consoles.
* You need to not ask the Developer(s) for support on how to run the clearly stated instructions in the Documentation.

**Documentation**

**You will have to do some general programming** and know Javascript or Typescript to fully understand what this script has to offer. The script itself takes some of the harder pieces of writing a roleplay script for GTA 5 and makes them more accessible.

This is a framework and not a out-of-the-box full-featured script. This framework aims to provide the bare minimum necessary to help you get your server running at a much faster rate.

## Is this for non-programmers?

No, this framework is meant to get people who have fiddled with programming languages off the ground and give them features that are already completed. This makes it much easier to start a Roleplay server, but adding the additional code necessary to make a full-featured server is a bit more difficult.

## Where to Purchase?

Configuration files may be purchased from [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/products/SKpPN).

_No there is not a lifetime package for Athena._

## Demo Server?

We have a small demo server available for you to test the framework with Administrative capabilities. You can check that out using the alt:V client at [https://altstats.net/server/504](https://altstats.net/server/504)
